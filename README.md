Get Python from : https://www.python.org/downloads/
Use 64 bits for your OS
PyCharm (any Edition) is ok. If you are full time developper you may need Pro. But CE works fine

Configure your local misp:

Default credentials for Web and CLI are: 
Login to CLI (misp:Password1234) and get your IP
It is DHCP by default. If you want a fix just change it, it is an Ubuntu 18.04 so it should be easy 
In your host file add an entry misp.local
At first Web login you must change the password, use HackFestDecade!
Default is admin@admin.test:admin
